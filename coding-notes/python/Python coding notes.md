Use message = to make a little shortcut
When doing a "name =" to print it do print(name.title())
You can make it upper case and lower case by changing title to upper or lower
For a full name just do first_name = and do the same for last name, then do full_name = f" {first_name} {last_name}"
For a list do; bicycles = ['something'] then do print
Remember 0= the first one
Put .title() to start with uppercase
Negative number makes print go backwards
